In the YAML header of your R Markdown document, replace this line:
output: html_document

with these lines (the indenting matters - two spaces and four spaces):

output:
  html_document:
    code_folding: hide

This change will allow your report to read like a typical document while still having the code available to
the reader should he or she want to see how you did your analysis and produced your figures.

___________________________

You will also want to replace the default setup chunk with this one:

knitr::opts_chunk$se(echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,quiet=TRUE,progress=FALSE,fig.align='center')

The chunk above ensuresyou don’t have undesired outputs appearing in your report (e.g., package loading messages, etc.).
